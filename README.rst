Introduction
============

Yet another Django forum app.

* Simple;
* More suited for an internal team use (like a company's extranet) than for big public communities;
* Have categories that contains threads that contains messages;
* Have thread watchs;
* Have thread sticky mode and announce mode;

TODO
----

* Use url namespace 'forum';
* Update to last Foundation5;
* Better Readme (With Install, etc..);

* Apply rights permissions (like for admin views only);
* Use Font Awesome webfonts with icomoon instead of the icomoon basic set;
* Redo mail sending for thread watchs;
* Use a lightweight RST as markup syntax in object descriptions and messages;
* Use https://github.com/twaddington/django-gravatar
